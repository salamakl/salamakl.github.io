## Exploring the Enigmatic World of 'Velvet Black - Notes'
---

Delve into the abstract photography of Fluer Olby, a North Yorkshire-based photographer whose work draws inspiration from the natural world, creatively transforming it through her lens. With an established studio practice in London, Olby's artistry takes center stage in her solo exhibition, "Velvet Black - Notes," where she seamlessly merges her two distinct series, "Velvet Black" and "Notes." This exhibition serves as a modern ode to Victorian plant shows with black velvet backdrops, encapsulating the transient beauty of daylight and blossoms. Her work, situated within the realm of abstract art, transcends conventional boundaries, evoking emotions and blurring the lines between reality and imagination. The selected image from "Velvet Black - Notes" offers a mesmerizing glimpse into a world where nature's secrets intertwine with art, inviting viewers to lose themselves in the enigmatic beauty of Olby's creations.
